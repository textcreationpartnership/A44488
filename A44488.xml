         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have you may ſee (though with ſome reluctancy as being conſcious to my ſelf of my own weakneſs, in ſpeaking to the great things of God and Chriſt) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed your deſires, for publiſhing what was upon my thoughts; and (as to ſome Heads thereof) was ſpoken to, and in the Family of your Deceaſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by occaſion of her Death and Burial. I pray God add his bleſſing with it, that it may provoke ſome at leaſt, yea all that read it, if it may be, to conſider their ways, whether they be good and righteous, and what the end toward which they tend: ſo that they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and live amiſs, may be there-through awakened to repentance, and to ſeek after righteouſneſs; even the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith: not reſting with <hi>Balaam</hi> in good Wiſhes and Deſires, or rather in Wiſhes and Deſires of Good, ſo as to miſs as he did, of the good they wiſh; but that awakening from ſin to righteouſneſſe and following after it, in ſeeking the Lord, they may both deſire and attain what is truly good: and that they that are in the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may through the conſideration of its good and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious end and reward, hold on their way to the end: So ſhould my labour herein be well beſtowed. And oh that both I and you may our ſelves do what we deſire and have herein, in ſome meaſure, endeavoured for others! that
<pb facs="tcp:31667:4"/> while we ſeek their good, we alſo minding the good way, may ſhare with all that are good, or get good here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in the reward. This briefly in General. Beſides which I would adde a word to either of you, Severally. And</p>
            <p>Firſt to you Mr. <hi>Daniel,</hi> let me ſay, Remember the good and grave counſel and advice of your Dear deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mother; eſpecially her dying farewell, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo to ſeek after the Lord, read and mind his good word, believe his love and grace toward mankind in his Son, and yield up your ſelf to obey and follow his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Counſels, preferring the Goſpel (as your good Mother adviſed you) not onely above the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, and what vain Companions, ſports and paſtimes can afford, or vain perſons entice you to, but alſo above your worldly eſtate; and ſo adhere to the good advice of ſuch as be ſober, ſtaid, and godly friends, that ſhe may at leaſt reap the fruit of all her ſerious wiſhes, deſires prayers and tears for your good, and of all her tender affectionate love to you, in her receiving you in the reſurrection of the juſt, at the comming of the Lord, in the lot and ſtate of the righteous and holy Saints and ſervants of God. You are young, and need help and direction. I would have you think ſo and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber minded: not thinking your ſelf ſo wiſe as that you may chuſe for your ſelf your ways, and need none to guide and counſel you; mind <hi>Solomons</hi> ſaying, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.10. <hi>And thine own friend and thy Mothers friend forſake thou not.</hi> Not taking any for your friends that would flatter you into vain courſes, to follow your will and pleaſures to your ruine; in all things mind Gods word, and call upon him for his grace and bleſſing in and through Chriſt Jeſus, and he will bleſs you and do you good. Seriouſly peruſe alſo this Treatiſe, and let its contents be ever with you. And the Lord bleſs it to you, That's all I ſhall ſay to you at preſent.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:31667:4"/>
            <p>As for thee, Dear Siſter, thou haſt cauſe to bleſs God for the good he hath done to you, and the mercy and grace he hath ſhewed you, both in your ſelf and in your Dear deceaſed Mother. Oh let not his goodneſs ever be forgotten by you, or ſlip out of your heart: follow yet on after righteouſneſs, and ſeek the Lord: the prize is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and aſcertained in Chriſt to you in following after it: onely watch and take heed of what may divert or ſubvert you from it, eſpecially of knowing your ſelf in what you know, and in the gifts God hath beſtowed on you, and ſo of being puffed up with any ſpiritual pride. Though not of that only, but alſo of every way of the world, or ſinful temptation by which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary will not be wanting to endeavour your harm, and whereof this Treatiſe alſo affords ſome notice and warning; but that's one main temptation he uſes againſt ſuch as are going on the right way, to make them reflect ſo upon their own beauty, put upon them by Chriſt as there-through to adulterate from Chriſt, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14, 15, 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was probably the way he fell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the looking upon and falling in love with his own created excellencies: and thence lifting up himſelf to deſire that that was proper to the Creator, and its the way he ſets upon many perſons (knowing perſons eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) to corrupt them from the ſimplicity of Chriſt, and an humble faithful dependance on him and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

But I hope, he that hath called you by, and into his grace will keep you through his grace from that and every other evil thing; and ſo cleanſe, ſanctifie, and make you perfect in every good thing, as that you ſhall without fail attain to the glory and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kingdom that he hath prepared for, and promiſed to them that love him. And in that hope and perſwaſion for you, I commit you to him and to his bleſsing. And

Being come to <hi>Balak,</hi> they prepare Altars and offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as proving if God might be moved by them, to put a curſe into his mouth againſt them, and goes to meet with God, who puts theſe words into his mouth that follow: Balak <hi>King of</hi> Moab <hi>hath brought me from</hi> Aram, <hi>from the mountains of the Eaſt, ſaying, Come curſe me</hi> Jacob: <hi>and come, defie</hi> Iſrael. <hi>How ſhall I curſe, whom God hath not curſed?

            <p n="1">1. To ſeek him more earneſtly, and apply our hearts to wiſdom in the knowledge of him in Chriſt Jeſus, ſeeing our times for that are not always. Whence that Prayer <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90.11. <hi>Teach us ſo to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wiſdom.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. He orders it to be an end, or put an end to our ſorrows, labours, temptations and exerciſes here, that we may reſt from them all, and be at quiet from moleſtations, from men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; <hi>for there the wicked ceaſe to trouble, and there the weary be at reſt; they hear not the voice of the Oppreſſors, Job.</hi> 3.17.18. <hi>they enter into peace, and reſt in their beds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1, 2.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To conform us to his bleſſed Son in ſufferings and death, and ſo in exerciſing ſuch faith in God and ſubmiſſion to him in reſigning our ſelves to his merciful diſpoſe, as he alſo exerciſed in reſigning up his ſpirit to him, depending upon him to diſpoſe of it, and in due time to raiſe him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Luc.</hi> 23.46. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

It is the deſire of Lovers to have ſome advantages or occaſions given them to ſhew the greatneſs and reallity of their love to them they love; whence that, <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits? Pſal.</hi> 116.112. and its ſome ſatisfaction and rejoycing when ſuch advantages

            <p n="8">8. To ſhew forth more abundantly the excellency of his power and glory in the Reſurrection, in raiſing them up again from the dead. For his power is made manifeſt in weakneſs, and is perfected in infirmities; how much more when we are ſo alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under the power of death and the grave, that it may ſeem impoſſible to be revived or brought up again. If the greatneſs of the power of God was ſeen in raiſing up Chriſt from the dead, ſure the greatneſs of the power and glory of Chriſt will be ſeen in raiſing up his people again, and making them therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to himſelf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.20, 21. this will be ſuch an evidence of his power, as ſhall make them indeed to know how infinitely great he is, and how true and faithful in his promiſes. Thence its ſaid, <hi>I will open your graves, oh my people, and cauſe you to come out of your graves, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you out of your graves, and put my ſpirit into you, and ye ſhall live, then ſhall ye know that I the Lord have ſpoken it, and have performed it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.12, 13, 14. To ſuch purpoſes, and for ſuch like good, holy, and gracious, and glorious ends doth God order death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the righteous alſo, and indeed in all this chiefly to magnify the greatneſs and glory of the Lord Jeſus, and his own in him, and for the benefit and profit of us. Whence its ſaid that death alſo is ours, the believers, not they its, but it theirs; their advantage mercy and priviledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. and according to theſe ſeveral conſiderations might we apply it. And eſpecially</p>

So little ſetting our hearts and affections upon this life and world, either to ſeek or delight in the enjoyment, or grieve for the want and loſs of the things thereof, as they that know that they and our enjoyments or wants of them, are but very momentany: and as having better things

            <p n="2">2 And ſeeing we muſt die, and death will put an end to our preſent ſufferings, temptations and afflictions, ſtabliſh we our hearts in the way of God, to hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith, and the practice of godlineſs firm without wavering to the end, as knowing that our ſufferings here, will not, nor can be everlaſting.

For here neither are the righteous evidently rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with, or enjoy the promiſed bleſſings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. nor the wicked puniſhed according to their wickedneſs, ſo as may either ſufficiently evidence Gods love and faithfulneſs to the one, or his wrath and hatred againſt the other, &amp; the truth of his threatnings.</p>
            <p>True it is, that God doth give ſome rewards, or rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to goodneſs here in inward peace and comfort, and oft-times in outward and ſignal preſervations and deliverances from dangers, and benefits conferred; Eſpecially to Societies and Companies of men, as Cities and Nations doing righteouſly and cleaving to it. For otherwiſe there would be no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here to ſerve God and walk in his wayes that might induce the world thereto, or ſuch as are chiefly yet ſenſual: But his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice muſt needs be a ſad and uncomfortable exerciſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in communities or common bodies, as Kingdoms, Cities, and Common-wealths as ſuch, which (as one well obſerves) ſhall never be reſtored into their publick capacities again, to be as ſuch rewarded. Nor would it be known by experience or ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally thought that the giving ſuch benefits here appertained to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31667:18"/> God, or that he takes notice of mens righteous or evil doings, if God ſhould give ſuch mercies to none that ask or deſire them, or that fear and ſerve him. And again on the other hand, true it is, that ſome wicked men (and eſpecially Nations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths for the reaſon above noted) are puniſhed here with ſevere and ſmart judgments for their wickedneſs, as <hi>Egipt,</hi>

               </note> the patience of God invites the wicked to repentance, and the Rod of God nurtures the good to patience. Sometime again the mercy of God embraces the good that are to be cheriſhed; and the ſeverity of God chaſtens the wicked that are to be puniſhed. Again, God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31667:19"/> would have theſe temporal matters common to both. That good men might neither greedily covet what good things they ſee, to be but the portion of the wicked here, nor ſhamefully avoid ſuch troubles as they ſee for the moſt part befall the good. Here then, evident it is, is neither the time nor place of the full manifeſtation of Gods righteous judgment on either: And therefore</p>
            <p n="3">3. It remains that ſeeing God hath ſaid he will puniſh all the workers of iniquity, and reward all that are righteous and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently perſevere in well doing; that there muſt be another, an aftertime and ſtate in which his word, that muſt not paſs or fall to the ground, ſhall be accompliſhed, and his righteouſneſs both to the one and the other, and his love to righteouſneſs and hatred of iniquity, be fully manifeſted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. which muſt therefore be after Death. But then again</p>
            <p n="4">4. Seeing in the ſtate of Death and ſeparation of the Body and Soul (though indeed there is a different diſpoſe of their Souls, as aforeſaid, and as will after appear and be more cleared; yet) what is done then to the Soul or Spirit by way of reward or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, is neither of the whole guilty or praiſe-worthy ſubject. The Body having ſinned alſo, and been active in the wickedneſs of the wicked, and on the other hand hath wrought what is good, and ſuffered injuries and wrongs for Chriſt and righteouſneſs ſake in the righteous; and its but right and reaſonable that the whole that ſhared in the work, ſhould ſhare too in the wages, (though the ſoul in both being the principal agent and mover of the body, its not unreaſonable that both in the one and the other it have the precedency, and ſo have what is allotted in the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſtate while the body lies dead and ſenſleſs:) as alſo ſeeing what happens to the ſoul or ſpirit, is not openly evident to the world, (if evident to thoſe ſpirits that partake of like ſtate) and its meet that Gods righteouſneſs be as openly and evidently ſeen in the world, to men &amp; angels, as mens works have been, &amp; as his Law and Doctrine have, which they therein kept or broke, as alſo the Promiſes and Threatnings therein. As alſo many things in the ſpirits (and bodily actings too) of men have been here hid, as alſo much of the reaſon of Gods dealings here; and he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed open-rewards, therefore it follows that it is neceſſary that there be a reſurrection and reviving both of good and bad from the dead, and the bringing them to a publike, viſible, open and manifeſt Judgement; ſo as God and Chriſt may be openly and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31667:20"/> manifeſtly glorified. And the good and bad receive open and manifeſt recompences for their works. So as both the good may be openly honoured and rewarded in the veiw of thoſe that have derided, and reproach'd them, and from and amongſt whom they have ſuffered for and practiced righteouſneſs. And the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be openly judged amongſt and by, and puniſhed in the veiw of thoſe over whom they have here gloryed and triumphed, and whom they here falſly judged and condemned.

For all have ſinned and ſwerved from that firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered uprightneſs and integrity, and have failed of the glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 23. But God ſtill abides juſt and righteous, though man be fallen from him; and that rightneſs and uprightneſs that he gave or made us in, his acts, doings, ways, words and works are all righteous, and there is no iniquity in him. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. He gave a righteous, juſt and holy Law, as a perfect Rule of righteouſneſs: according to which he that ſhould do ſhould live, and enjoy his favor and bleſſing; but he that ſwerves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and continues not in all things contained therein, is crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unjuſt; unrighteous and condemned by it to die, yea ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed and blaſted of God in his moſt holy and righteous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But this coming in upon fallen man, and being propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to him as a Rule, to meaſure himſelf by, and ſquare his heart and actions after, findes him ſo deſperately crooked and diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his fall, that it altogether pronounces againſt man and condemns him. And while man would ſet himſelf to conform himſelf to it in heart and way, he is thereby convinced that he is wrong and unrighteous: For by the Law is the knowledge of ſin; yea, ſin taking occaſion by it, it is more awakened and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to exert and act forth it ſelf, when it findes the Law its enemy to forbid, reſtrain and curb it, and ſtrives to bear it down before it, or elſe ſecretly to elude it. And ſo man in ſtead of being made juſt and righteous by it, is diſcovered to be more vile and ſinful; yea, occaſionally is made ſo, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>the Law entred that ſin might abound.</hi> And in Chap. 7.5 8, 9.

So as that God teſtifies of him once, and again, that he was well pleaſed in, or with him, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.5. for he delighted to do his will, his Law was in his heart, his ear he opened, and he was not rebellions nor turned back, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8, 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. and indeed in reſpect of his perfect obedience to God, and conformity to his Law, he was juſtified thereby, and ought to have lived and to be bleſſed; but yet though he had done ſo, and thoſe things were due to him, God his Father willing him to lay down all that life and bleſſing, and take upon himſelf (as our nature and Law, ſo now) alſo our ſin and curſe, and notwithſtanding life and bleſſing was his due, to die for us and be made a curſe; he willingly for our ſake did ſo, and ſo he ſuffered, the juſt for the unjuſt, and died for the ungodly, that he might bring us unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. it happened to him, the righteous One, according to the work and deſert of us wicked and ungodly ones, that it might happen to us ungodly ones ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the work of him the juſt and righteous One; for he

Many ſuch perſons, good and upright men both in the primitive and later perſecutions ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch things, they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, they were tempted; (or as ſome read it, were burnt with hot irons) ſome dyed in the waters, ſome in the fire, ſome roſted on grid-irons, ſome pulled in pieces, devoured by wild-beaſts, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained any cruelty the wit or malice of men and Devils could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe. <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſied alſo, <hi>that many ſuch ſhould fall</hi> (that is die or be ſlain) <hi>by the ſword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by ſpoile, Dan.</hi> 11.33.

            <p n="2">2. Incloſed in and compaſſed about, as it were, with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of his death, ſacrifice, and mediation, which gives infinite ſafety and ſecurity againſt what might harm, and powerful title to what he hath thereby purchaſed, and obtained.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In his favour alſo, <hi>beloved of him as he was of his Father,</hi> as he ſaith himſelf in <hi>Job.</hi> 15.9. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. In him as united with, ſtanding and abiding in him, <hi>as a Root in the ſoyl, Col.</hi> 2.6, 7. or as <hi>a Branch in the vine Joh.</hi> 15.1, 14. or as <hi>a Member in the body,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. and ſo intereſted in the fatneſs of the ſoyl or ſtock, the good things that are Chriſts; and ſo in all the ſafety, honour and welfare of the Head. And by vertue hereof</p>
            <p n="2">2. They die in a ſtate of choice and peculiar favour with God, (Chriſt in whom they are, being his beloved one, owned, accepted and juſtified) however otherwiſe accuſed and condemned here of men; and this is ſignifyed by the white robes to be given them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.11. whether they die a natural death, and quietly in their beds, or a violent, ſharp or ſhameful death, all is one, dying in Chriſt they die in Gods love and favour even as he did. Thence it was the great deſire of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to win Chriſt and be found in him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3 8, 9. knowing that otherwiſe it could not be well with him, but in him he ſhould be found of God in peace, and without blame before him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.22, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They die in Covenant with God, <hi>for Chriſt is given for a Covenant to the people, an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. and 49.8. and 55.3. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. and <hi>ſo he is ſtill their God even in death, Pſal.</hi> 48.14. God having inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to Chriſt, and to all in him, to be their God, and to own them for his peculiar ones, and to do good to all in Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatneſs of his love and mercy for Chriſts ſake. They
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31667:30"/> that are Chriſts are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and heirs according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or to the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſumme whereof was, that <hi>he would be his God, and the God of his ſeed after him, Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. (Covenant and promiſe ſignifying one and the ſame thing with the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15.16.29.) and the being Chriſts, is a conſequent of being in the faith of Chriſt, and of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereby put on Chriſt, <hi>Ver.</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29. So as that dying in Chriſt or in the faith of him, they muſt needs be in the Covenant of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They die in hope, or have hope in their death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32. the righteous hath hope in his death by vertue of Chriſt Jeſus, who is our hope, the heir of all the promiſes and bleſſings of God, and the Covenant of them to us, dying in him heires of God and his promiſes; there muſt needs be great hope for them, even of the injoyment of all the good that is promiſed, and by Chriſts death and mediation aſſured and ſecured, which reſpect the ſtate after death, and in the life or world to come; for alſo in Chriſt</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are holy to God, he being made holineſs to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. they are Gods portion as well in death as in life: <hi>his Saints, Pſal.</hi> 116.15. and God is not aſhamed to be called their God, the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in their dying, as well as in their living: and therefore from, and in all theſe</p>
            <p n="6">6. They are bleſſed in their Death. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, Rev.</hi> 14.13. that is, they are happy, they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from their ſins, <hi>for bleſſed the man whoſe iniquities are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whoſe ſins are covered. Bleſſed the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin, Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. they have nothing to be charged fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon them, nay all bleſſing is theirs, a happy and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Exceeding great too are their advantages thereby, as to ſay</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their fight is fought, their labour and work finiſhed, and their race run, they have now no more to do that may be looked upon, as any condition to be performed by them, upon which the promiſes of God, and their injoyment of happineſs is in any wiſe ſuſpended; while we live here there is yet an <hi>If</hi> upon us, ſome thing to be done by us, upon which our happineſs is in a ſort ſuſpended, ſo as in failing therein we may pull judgment upon our ſelves, as in <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>Chriſt will preſent you blameleſs, if you continue in the faith rooted and grounded, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel, Heb.</hi> 3.6. <hi>whoſe houſe we are, if we hold
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31667:30"/> faſt the confidence, and the rejoycing of the hope firm to the end,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. <hi>So run that ye may obtain. If we die with him, we ſhall live with him; if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall reign with him,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.11, 12. But now when death comes and paſſes upon the righteous, they may ſay with Chriſt, <hi>it is finiſhed,</hi> or as <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> or as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith;</hi> henceforth no more work to do, but only to go to God, and the Crown is reſerved, and laid up for them, to be given them at the day of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. their labour is at an end, their warfare accompliſhed, and they go to reſt. And ſo</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their ſufferings and ſorrows are at an end too, here they have laboured and ſuffered reproach, and many afflictions are while they are here endured by them, <hi>through much affliction and tribulation we muſt enter the Kingdom,</hi> Act. 14.22. <hi>Ye ſhall weep and lament,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>and ye ſhall have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,</hi> Joh. 16.20, 21, 22, 33. <hi>This is their ſeed-time when they go forth weeping, bearing forth their precious ſeed,</hi> Pſal. 126.6. now they are in heavineſs through manifold temptations if need be, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. grapling ſometimes with their own corruptions, <hi>Wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this Death, the Law in their members warring againſt the Law of their mind, Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. they have luſts warring againſt their ſouls, that they muſt abſtain from and ſtrive againſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3, 4, ſometimes with Satan winnowing, tempting, buffetting, and every way playing their adverſary, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.31. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8. Sometimes with the world, frowning, threatning, oppoſing, perſecuting them in ſundry and divers ſorts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16.19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12, 13. Sometimes under the righteous and merciful hand of God afflicting and rebuking, and ſometimes more ſharply ſcourging and filling with bitterneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Job.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous here, Pſal.</hi> 34.19. But now in their death all theſe are at an end, they then are delivered from the evil, ſo as no more to be under the grief or vexation thereof, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. neither evil men nor evil ſpirits ſhall any more afflict or exerciſe them, nor will Gods hand go any further upon them to afflict them: They reſt from their labours in both ſenſes, even from their labouring under pains taking and ſorrows too, <hi>and hear the voice of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor no more,</hi> Job. 3.17, 18.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:31667:31"/>3. Their dangers are now all paſt, they are paſt the danger of ſinning, offending, and provoking God to diſpleaſure which they are in, ſo long as they live, there is need of watching and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes till that day be come, <hi>Luc.</hi> 21.36. but in their yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their ſpirits to God, they are paſt thoſe ſnares that before they were among; then the Devil hath no more power to tempt them, nor are they any more in danger to be tempted by him or overcome of him, or of any of the flatteries or threats of the world, the perſons or things therein; their race is run, their goal is obtained, no further danger now of fainting, failing or ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide, the Devil or world can no more now come at them to touch them, for their ſpirits go to God, and are in his hand and diſpoſe, and their ſtate from henceforth fixed, ſo as they are in no danger of going to hell now, being therefrom exempted and otherwiſe diſpoſed of for ever, <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.27. And ſurely this is a moſt deſirable condition to be out of all labour, ſorrows and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which this world is full of perpetually. Yea,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now they go home to be with Chriſt, in his preſence and ſure protection, as at home with him, and in the enjoyment of him in their ſpirits, where it is better to be than any where here, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. But that leads us to the next particular, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">The latter end of the righteous</note>4. The after-ſtate or latter end of the righteous, what that is, and what its excellency. The very diſcovery of it will ſhew its excellency abundantly; and its conſiderable in three Branches.</p>

            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of their body: indeed as to its viſible appearing condition it differs nothing from the ſtate of the body of the wicked; for they both are of the duſt, and both go to the duſt; even Chriſt himſelf made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9. yea, many times in that reſpect the wicked have the advantage; they get honorable Burials when the bodies of the Saints ſometimes get none at all, or very mean ones. We read that the wicked rich man whoſe ſoul went to hell, yet as to his body, it after death had a burial, <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.22. which in many wicked rich men is very honorable; but as for poor <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> though after his death carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, yet we read of no burial afforded him. Nay, we read of many of the Saints, that their dead bodies have been given for meat to the ſowls of heaven, and their fleſh to the beaſts of the earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31667:31"/> 2, 3 But yet for all this, the bodies of the righteous are in a better ſtate after death, than the bodies of the wicked; let the wicked do what they can or will to and with them, <hi>for not an hair of their heads ſhall periſh, Luc.</hi> 21.18. Yea, their bodies be happy becauſe they be their bodies who are in Covenant with God, and in his favour in their death, and their death puts not an end to their being ſo; whence God is called the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> after they were dead and buried, and long before the time of their reſurrection, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. and that pertains not to their ſpirits only, but to their bodies alſo; for by that our Saviour proves the reſurrection of the dead which is properly of the body, as the Apoſtle ſhews clearly in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. <hi>This corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall put on immortality, and he ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the likeneſs of his glorious body, Philip.</hi> 3.21. I ſay our Saviour proves by that his being the God of <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> that the dead ſhall riſe, as implying that he is God of their bodies alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 32, 33. So that the bodies of the righteous, even when in the grave, are Gods to take care of and in Covenant with him, to bring in his due time, as the members of Chriſt to the enjoyment of his bleſſing; even as the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when dead, had the denomination of the Lord,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17</note> becauſe his body that was and is the Lord, and in union with the Deity, though then dead, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.6. <hi>Come ſee the place where the Lord lay;</hi> So alſo the bodies of the Saints have the denomination of the Saints whoſe bodies they were and are, and ſo have intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Chriſt, in which and in whom they are, though dead. So <hi>Davids</hi> body, and <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs,</hi> are called by their names in the Scriptures. <hi>Theſe were the dayes of the years of the life of</hi> Abraham—<hi>and he dyed—and his ſons</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Iſhmael <hi>buried him,</hi> that is his body, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.8. the like is ſaid of <hi>Sarah,</hi> Abraham <hi>buried</hi> Sarah <hi>his wife, Gen.</hi> 23.19. and ſo its ſaid of <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 35.28. and of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 50, 1.13. and this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their bodies, as being their bodies, intitles them in and through Chriſt, to all the future happineſs of them.

Again its ſaid to be, when abſent from the body, at home with the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8 ſo as a child at home with his Father, or a Wife with her Husband; now as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the child is more ſafe, comfortable, and deſirable when at

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31667:37"/> Majeſty: ſo he ſo loved him as both to prepare an infinite reward for him being righteous; or for ſuch, or ſo many of them as ſhould be found righteous before him; for the manifeſtation of the riches of his grace, and glorious bounty and goodneſs to him; and alſo when he fell from his primitive and created righteouſneſs in which he made him, he made his Son, (the increated image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and of his eſſential righteouſneſs) to be in the image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fallen man, in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and under ſin, and curſe, and condemnation (only without ſin in him) that he being clothed as it were with mans unrighteouſneſs as imputed to him, and ſwallowing up the ſin and curſe, might himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his perfect righteouſneſs, and conforming him to himſelf in holineſs and righteouſneſs, might make him alſo the ſubject in, and with himſelf of that infinite reward prepared for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even that infinite glory and inconceivable happineſs which he had before the world prepared for them: as it is ſaid, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from before the foundations of the world, Math.</hi> 25.35. and <hi>Fear not little Flock it is my Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom, Luc.</hi> 12.32. Thence the Praedeſtination to the adoption of children, and to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the inheritance, is ſaid to be according to the good pleaſure of his will, and according to his good purpoſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5, 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſprings from his love to righteouſneſs, even to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith; or to his only bleſſed Son made in the vertues of his abaſement, obedience, and ſufferings, righteouſneſs to them: as his love and pitty to man led him to give his Son to ranſom him from his unrighteouſneſs, and to be his righteouſneſs; ſo his love to righteouſneſs, even to his Son, made mans righteouſneſs, leads him ſo to love man as found therein, as to think nothing too good or great for him, even himſelf, and all his fulneſs of grace and glory to be his portion in life and death, but moſt fully and manifeſtly in the life to come. Thence the care of the Apoſtle to be found in Chriſt, in order to his apprehending that for which he was apprehended of Chriſt, and to his obtaining the price of Gods high calling in him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8, 9, 12, 14. God loving them that love Chriſt, becauſe they love Chriſt, with this manner of loving of them, whence he ſo rewards them, <hi>Joh,</hi> 16.27, 28. whence alſo their election, though before the foundation of the world, is ſaid to be in Chriſt, and their praedeſtination to the adoption of children to be by Chriſt.

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:31667:37"/>3. It ſprings from the infinite excellency of the perſon, and the precious vertuouſneſs of the abaſement and obedience of the Lord Jeſus to the death, the death of the Croſs, and the force and prevalency of his mediation of the new Teſtament with God his Father in the vertues thereof, <hi>that the called might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the eternel inheritance, Heb.</hi> 9.15. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. For though, if man had abode in his innocency, he I believe ſhould have been very happy, out of the love that God beares to righteouſneſs, and to man as his creature abiding righteous: yet as it is no where ſaid, ſo neither find I ſufficient ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he ſhould have had the ſame happineſs that now he ſhall have in, and upon the account of Chriſt Jeſus: he not only delivering him from his ſin, but being made alſo ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to man as made in him, as becomes a new and more glorious foundation of his future happineſs, then his owne perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as a pure creature could have been; Therefore alſo it is ſaid, that Gods eternal purpoſe about the Goſpel-contents were purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. and that Chriſt at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhall be admired in all his Saints: it being the glory of Chriſt that ſhall then be manifeſted in and upon them; even that that he hath by the vertues of his abaſement, ſufferings and death, acquired into the nature of man for us, and to be communicated by and with him to us, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. and 2.14. Its the great commendation and Manifeſtation of the ſtrength and excellency of this foundation, that it is counted worthy of, and meet for ſuch a glorious ſuperſtructure to be built upon it, and that its able to ſupport and uphold ſuch a weight, an exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Sure if our ſufferings in, and for him work for us ſuch a weight of glory, as ſome particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of them in that Kingdom, what did his ſufferings for us work (whence all our ſufferings for him have their foundation, motive and value) but even the whole Kingdom it ſelf, and all its glory! Such was his unſpeakable love and grace in abaſing himſelf ſo low at the will and appointment of his Father, and ſuffering ſo great things for man, that as he is accounted worthy to receive of God his Father higheſt dignity, honor, and glory in the manhood, and for men, even power and riches, wiſdom and ſtrength, honor and glory and bleſſing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. ſo alſo ſuch is the infinite prevalency of his mediation with his Father through the ſame, that he obtains of him what he deſires: and ſuch is his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31667:38"/> infinite love and grace to his that love and obey him, that as his Father loves him, ſo he loves them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9. and therefore aim'd at, askes and obtaines of his Father for them, the higheſt and moſt inconceivable happineſs and glory that may be injoyed by them: whence alſo we may ſay, that</p>
            <p n="4">4 It ſprings from Chriſts unſpeakeable love to them, as his Members, Spouſe, Inheritance; which is ſuch as that he thinks nothing too good or great for them, that he hath in his power, or may by his power and prevalency obtain of God for them. Thence he tells them, <hi>that he appoints to them a Kingdom as his Father appointed him, that they may ſit, and eat, and drink with him at his table in his Kingdom, and ſit on thrones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.28, 29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. and 3.21. and to give to them to ſit with him on his throne: <hi>and he gave himſelf for his Church, that he may ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify it with the waſhing of water in the word; to preſent it to himſelf a Glorious Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26, 27. improving all the infinite vertues of his Croſs and Sufferings, and all the authority and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer he hath with his Father, and over all things, for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to the heighth of happineſs. How great muſt that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs needs be? how great that glory that ſhall be to the heighth of Chriſts power and intereſt! by which alſo they are prepared for that glory and brought to it too. Whence the Spouſe glories alſo, <hi>my beloved is mine.</hi> He, and all that he is and hath, <hi>and I am his,</hi> to love, delight in, and make me happy; as well as alſo to obey and ſerve him. Yea</p>
            <p n="5">5. It ſprings from the love both of the Father and Son to them, which leads them ſo to accept of any their breathings after them, love and ſervices to them, as to reward them not after their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs in themſelves, but according to the graciouſneſs of their own acceptance of them in their love to them, and according to the infinite munificence and magnificence of ſo great and glorious perſons: ſo as they may ſhew forth the glory of their grace and love therein to them, and upon them.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It ſprings from the truth and faithfulneſs of God and Chriſt: for whereas love and goodneſs led or moved God and Chriſt to promiſe ſo great and glorious recompences to them that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their corruptions, and luſts, and wills, and enemies, in the power of his grace given them in Chriſt; and that do not through ſloth, cowardlineſs, or contempt of the riches of his goodneſs, unbelief, or the like, yeild themſelves to them: his faithfulneſs,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31667:38"/> truth, and power are ingaged to perform and make good theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to them. To which he hath bound himſelf both by promiſe and oath, that by two immutable things in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, they may have ſtrong conſolation that flee for refuge to the hope ſet before them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13.17, 18. Now God is faithful and able to perform that that he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and will not faile: his righteouſneſs ſhall be ſeen and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therefore in the performance to the heires of promiſe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly it ſprings alſo from the great wiſdom of God, that ſuch and ſo great a reward and End was prepared for, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by him, that he may induce and incourage the hearts of poor mortal creatures to obedience to the faith of Jeſus, and to the way and practiſe of righteouſneſs. For ſuch is the power of corruption, errour, and ignorance in us naturally; ſuch the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful influences of this world, and its allurements upon us, ſuch the force alſo of its threats, frownes and hardſhips to be met with in the way of God: and ſuch the force and violence of Satan in thruſting againſt us in, and with all afore-mentioned, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ruine us; that did not God bid ſo high for us and our ſervice, he would have few that would deny themſelves of the baits, and encounter with, and ſtand againſt the difficulties and diſcouragements they meet with. But the veiw of ſuch a price, or prize kept in the eye may, and doth, and will allure, and draw, and keep up the heart in, and through Chriſt Jeſus to all the ſervices, and carry through all the ſufferings he calls to. Thence thoſe frequent expreſſions of reſpect to the reward had and exerciſed by the Saints, as the Patriarchs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Moſes</hi> Verſ. 25.26, 27. the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12. 14, 16, 17, 18. and 5.1. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.12, 14. Yea Chriſt himſelf as man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. and the frequent mention and propoſal of it to others to animate and hearten them on, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. with 7.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10, 11, 12, 13. and 10.35, 36, 37. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. and God is juſt to perform his bargaine; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given alſo an earneſt of it to his ſervants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1 13, 14. Such the grounds and reaſons of this ſo happy a Death, and after-ſtate, which yet we have hitherto conſidered only abſolutely: it will be yet more manifeſt (contraries being ſet off and illuſtrated the more by their contraries) to be deſirable, if we veiw the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition of the Death and after-part of the unrighteous and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31667:39"/> wicked,<note place="margin">The after-part or latter end of the wicked.</note> and ſo veiw it Comparatively. Comparing it with the portion of the wicked, and ſee how it excels that. But who can expreſs either of them to the life, either the excellency of the End of the righteous, or the miſery of the End of the ungodly and wicked? the Pſalmiſt tells us: <hi>The End of the tranſgreſſors ſhall be cut off, Pſal.</hi> 37.38. <hi>Eli</hi> tells his Sons, <hi>it will be bitterneſs in the End,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.26. Yea the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> implies it to be inexpreſſible bitterneſs, <hi>bitterer than wormwood</hi> (as is ſaid of the End of the whoriſh woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.3, 4.) when he ſaith; <hi>what ſhall the End be of thoſe that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> as wanting words to expreſs the bitterneſs and badneſs of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. We might ſhew it to be in all things contrary to the End of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or upright, both as to their ſtate in dying, and as to their after-ſtate both in the time of their being dead, and in and after their Reſurrection.

Death is the inlet to them to infinite and endleſs miſeries: for they die out of Chriſt, and have no ſhare in him, or in the bleſſings in him, and ſo they are accurſed both in ſoul and body. Its true, the body (as we ſaid before) may be more honorably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred than the righteous mans; but yet its the body of a wicked man that hath no part in Chriſt, and therefore dies in his ſins, which are all chargeable upon him both ſoul and body, and the punniſhment hangs over him, and begins now to ſeize upon him. Being not in Chriſt, he is not in Gods favor and acceptance nor under any promiſe of any good, mercy, or bleſſing: but under all the threatnings of curſe and miſery; his hope is periſhed, what ever he had in the world, its gone with the world; and if he had any hope in God upon account of his birth, parentage, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, works, goodneſs in his own eyes, its blown all away with his breath which he breathed our when he gave up the ghoſt.

            <p>That a wicked man abiding a wicked man,<note place="margin">Anſ. <hi>1.</hi> Not abiding wicked.</note> can by no means have ſuch a death, and after-part as the righteous and upright ones. <hi>Except your righteouſneſs</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Scribes and Pharaſees, ye can in no wiſe enter the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Math. 5.20. that is, except men be truly righteous they cannot enjoy Gods Kingdome which is the end and portion of the righteous;<note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> and the reaſon is becauſe</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is againſt the purity and holineſſe of God to admit wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and ſo wicked men abiding and continuing ſuch, into ſuch nighneſs with himſelf, and ſo into his favour and affection as the righteous be; <hi>for the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, Pſal.</hi> 11.8. <hi>and the righteous, Pſal.</hi> 146.8. but he is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, evil may not dwell with him: fools may not ſtand in his ſight, he hateth all the workers of iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5. He is of purer eyes than to behold evil and iniquity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. and therefore cannot admit wicked men, as, and while ſuch, to come into his Kingdom, and have part with the righteous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That would make void all the ends and intents of the Death of Chriſt, and all the whole work and buſineſs of his undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for if men might be ſaved and enjoy God in their ſins, then they might have been ſaved without Chriſts coming and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them: for why ſhould Chriſt come to take away ſins, and waſh and make us clean from them, if God can endure them in his ſight and preſence unwaſhed away from men? yea and why then was God angry with men for ſinning? yea and Chriſt ſhould then fail of his undertaking, if undertaking to bring men to God clean and pure from their ſins, he ſhould bring them in their uncleanneſs to him; in vain is a coſtly Bath prepared for waſhing and healing men, if they may be well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Chriſts coming therefore on purpoſe to take away our ſins in order to our enjoyment of happineſs, is an evident demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we may not be happy in them.

            <p n="4">4.

The frame and fabrick of heaven and earth, and all variety of creatures therein, and his not reſting from his works till he had provided us of all things that might give us reſt, do abundantly teſtifie. But when we had by our ſin forfeited all theſe benefits, ſee how our miſeries rather added to his diligence, and increaſt the workings of his love and pitty toward us, then any whit abated them, we had made him more work, and he diſdained it not. He looked out for a ranſome for us, and found it, when neither men or Angels could have invented one.

He accepted his Fathers will, came down from heaven to do it, did it with cheerfulneſs, delighted to do it, was incarnate, acted, and did good; ſuffered, ſorrowed, dyed, and therein bare our ſins and carryed our ſorrows; reſted not till having made a purgation for our ſins by his blood, ſlain the enmity, broken down the wall of partition, deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; aboliſhed death, taken out of the midway what might hinder us from coming back to God and to happineſs; made peace for us, perfected righteouſneſs, obtained an eternal redemption: offering up himſelf a perfect ſacrifice to his Father, he received of him what ever power, glory and fulneſs might furniſh and fit him to be the Author of eternal ſalvation to all that obey him, and then he ſat down and reſted at the right hand of God. And yet as the Father worketh hitherto for our good, ſo he worketh alſo; and is faithfully mediating with him for us, and digging about and dreſſing us, ſending forth his ſervants, and with them his Word and Spirit, calling, counſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The holy Spirit alſo as he was one in deviſing help and preparing it, in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſanctifying the body of Chriſt, and ſtrengthning him in all his ſervices and ſufferings for us <hi>(for in the eternal Spirit be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up himſelf without ſpot to God, Heb. 9, 14.)</hi> ſo he in the name of Chriſt and of God in him, ſtrives in and with men, inlightning, calling, reproving, convincing, moving, promiſing, threatning, withdrawing, and returning againe and uſing all means to wooe and turn us to Chriſt, and confirme us in him that we might live and not die.

A woman of a good report many years, and of noted zeal and fervency in what ſhe apprehended to be the truth and right way of God, walking for diverſe years with, and of good note, among ſome people called <hi>Independants:</hi> amongſt whom her love and liberality, zeal and diligence in ſeeking after God, according to their principles, were conſpicuous, and her yet remaining works for them and their entertainment ſpeak yet for her. But it pleaſed God in proceſs of time to open her underſtanding in the Scriptures of truth and righter way of the Lord, in giving her to perceive his Grace in Chriſt to all mankind, according to the received doctrine of the Church
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31667:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> of <hi>England,</hi> and freeneſs to impart it to all, and intereſt any of all there-through in his everlaſting Covenant in coming to him, and to bring her into acquaintance with a people believing and walking therein. Chiefly I think, by means of her ſon in law, Mr <hi>Jeremy Coleman,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Hetherſeſt</hi> in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> a man of a ſweet and excellent ſpirit, and uſefully precious in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; who ſome years before her, though young, was taken away as a chaſtiſement to many yet ſurviving. How readily ſhe received the Teſtimony of the Grace of God in its extent, and how well ſhe reliſht it, and retained it, and how blameleſly and uprightly ſhe walked in it for divers years before her deceaſe, and untill her deceaſe, I ſuppoſe many can Teſtifie. And ſo that ſhe was ſo far as men may judge, a truly righteous perſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſeeking and accepting of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt only to be her righteouſneſs in her generation to her capacities, which were none of the meaneſt. Her conſtancy in the faith of Chriſt, her love to it, her charity and liberality, her blameleſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet live in the memories of diverſe, though ſhe be dead now ſome time ſince, and long may they there live. A woman ſhe was that had a cloſe therefore better than his that died unlamented, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed worthy to be lamented in reſpect of others, though to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in, in behalfe of her ſelf.
